Popular choices are YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or similar architectures.\\n\\n2. **Depth Estimation (Optional but Highly Recommended):**  Accurately determining the distance of objects from the ego-vehicle is critical for safety assessment. Stereo vision or lidar data can be integrated here.\\n\\n3. **Tracking:** Track objects over time to predict their trajectories and potential conflicts.\\n\\n4. **Risk Assessment:** Develop a rule-based system or use machine learning to assess the risk of each detected object based on its type, proximity, speed, trajectory, and other factors.  This is crucial for differentiating between truly hazardous objects and those that are not an immediate threat.\\n\\n5. **JSON Generation:** Structure your hazard assessment results into a JSON file. The structure could be similar to my previous examples, but will likely require more detailed information to reflect the complexity of your videos.  An example field might include the probability of collision or a hazard score.\\n\\n\\nI can help you design the JSON schema once you have the results from steps 1-4, but I cannot perform the video processing and risk analysis directly.
