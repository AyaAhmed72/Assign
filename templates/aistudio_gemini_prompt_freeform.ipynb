These tools will identify objects within the video frames.\\\\n3. **Manually assess harmfulness:** The tool's output will likely identify objects but might not inherently classify them as \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"harmless\\\\\\\" to a car. You will need to manually review the identified objects and their context within the videos to determine their potential impact on a car (e.g., a rock is potentially harmful if it impacts the windshield, while a cloud is harmless).\\\\n4. **Create the JSON:**  Finally, you'll need to create the JSON output based on your analysis, structuring it according to your desired format.  For example, the JSON might look like this:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n```json\\\\n{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"video1\\\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"objects\\\\\\\": [\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"rock\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n        \\\\\\\"reasoning\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Could cause damage to windshield or undercarriage if the car drives over it.\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"tree\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n        \\\\\\\"reasoning\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Could cause significant damage if the car collides with it.\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"person\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\": true,\\\\n        \\\\\\\"reasoning\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Potential for collision resulting in injury and/or car damage.\\\\\\\"\\\\n      }\\\\n    ]\\\\n  },\\\\n  \\\\\\\"video2\\\\\\\": {\\\\n    \\\\\\\"objects\\\\\\\": [\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"car\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\": false,\\\\n        \\\\\\\"reasoning\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Another car; potential for collision, but classified as potentially harmful only if involved in an accident.\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"object\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"bird\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"harmful\\\\\\\": false,\\\\n        \\\\\\\"reasoning\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Unlikely to cause any damage to the car.\\\\\\\"\\\\n      }\\\\n    ]\\\\n  }\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nRemember to replace the example objects and reasoning with your actual findings from the video analysis.  The structure can be adapted to your specific needs.\\\\n\\\\n\"\n",
